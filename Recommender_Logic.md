1. MovieRatingDataset (Lines 20-40)
This is a PyTorch Dataset class that handles the MovieLens ratings data:
Purpose: Converts rating data into a format suitable for neural network training
Key components:
Stores user IDs, movie IDs, and ratings
Creates mappings between IDs and indices for the neural network
Implements __getitem__ to return tensors for training
2. NeuralCollaborativeFiltering (Lines 43-96)
This is the core neural network model:
Purpose: Implements a deep learning model for collaborative filtering
Architecture:
Embedding layers: Convert user and movie IDs into dense vectors
MLP layers: Multi-layer perceptron with ReLU activation and dropout
Output layer: Single neuron predicting rating (1-5 scale)
Key features:
Xavier weight initialization for better training
Concatenates user and movie embeddings
Configurable embedding dimensions and hidden layer sizes
3. MovieRecommender (Lines 99-519) - Main Class
This is the primary class that orchestrates the entire recommendation system:
Core Functionality:
Data Management: Loads MovieLens dataset, manages user ratings
Model Training: Trains the neural collaborative filtering model
Recommendations: Generates personalized movie recommendations
User Interaction: Provides interactive rating interface
Key Methods:
Data & Training:
load_data(): Loads MovieLens dataset and creates ID mappings
train_model(): Trains the neural network with train/test split
load_user_ratings() / save_user_ratings(): Persistent rating storage
Recommendations:
get_recommendations(): Uses collaborative filtering to find similar users
_find_similar_users(): Calculates user similarity using Jaccard similarity
_calculate_weighted_rating(): Predicts ratings based on similar users' preferences
User Interface:
rating_loop(): Interactive interface for rating movies
add_user_rating(): Adds/updates user ratings
display_recommendations(): Shows formatted recommendation results
How It Works:
Training Phase: The model learns patterns from existing MovieLens ratings
Rating Phase: User rates movies they've watched
Recommendation Phase: System finds users with similar tastes and predicts ratings for unrated movies
Output: Displays top recommendations based on predicted ratings
The system uses a hybrid approach - it trains a neural collaborative filtering model on the full dataset, but for new users (cold start problem), it falls back to traditional collaborative filtering by finding similar users based on rating patterns.
This is a sophisticated recommendation system that combines modern deep learning techniques with traditional collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations!
